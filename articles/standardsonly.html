    <h2>Learn standards, not frameworks</h2>
    <span class="articleDate">2017-10-01</span>
    <p>
        Regardless of the language / tools you use to develop, the closer you stick to the standard, the easier maintenance and future
        updates will be. The only issue with standards is that little 's' at the end - Standards are not always standard.
        You will know this if you ever created a webpage only to find your CSS not interpreted the same on all browsers.
        You can bang your head against the wall to try and reach every browser out there, or use a radical approach...
        <br> Only support the W3C standard ( <a href='https://www.w3.org/standards/' target="_blank">https://www.w3.org/standards/</a>)
        <br>I know you want to reach as large an audience as possible, but think about it - your job is to develop a website,
        not to develop shims / polyfills to adress a browser vendors bad implementation. The only polyfill you should have is
        to test the browser and inform them they should upgrade to the latest version or switch browsers altogether. If everyone
        does this, and the general public gets educated about their favourite browser's deficiencies it might just cause
        the 4 giant browsers to better implement the standard rather than risk losing customers (read ad views).
        <br> The web standard really matured these last couple of years, making libraries like jquery obsolete - 
        the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll">querySelectorAll()</a>        
        makes it easy to use css style selectors to find elements in javascript, 
        and the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API">fetch()</a> api makes calling rest 
        endpoints a breeze.
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals">Template Literals</a> 
        are a great alternative to templating engines / ui frameworks, and bidirectional databinding is easy to implement
        yourself as illustrated <a href="https://gist.github.com/austinhyde/4321f22a476e1cbee65f">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you learn a framework you are locked in to that vendors vision of the web, usually with an "all or nothing"
        approach. While documentation on (the big) frameworks have greatly imporved over the last few years, the difference with standards are that the specification comes first, and
        implementation comes second. When using standards you actually have direct access to the original specification, vs 
        the document author's interpretation of the developers interpretation of the specification.
    </p>
    <p>
        Specification first is not without its drawbacks - there is nothing like discovering a perfect feature to solve
        a problem, only to see it is still experimental or under review. Defnitively stay AWAY from features that are not
        yet accepted into the standard - you can get away with forcing cutting edge stable features on your clients, but not bleeding edge.
